# Covid_Elections
Election management system during the Covid period. Citizens, polling stations/ballot boxes, candidates and parties can be added to the system. A citizen can only vote if he is over the age of 18. If his age is between 18 and 21, he is considered a soldier and belongs to the soldiers' ballot box. If the citizen is in isolation, he votes in a special ballot box for those in isolation. The election results are shown in a pie diagram. Implemented in Java, using JavaFX.
